# YOLO26s + CoordAtt: Resource-Constrained Aerial Small-Object Detection

> Real-time detection of 7 object classes from drone imagery, optimized for 8 GB VRAM consumer GPUs.

## Overview

This project explores aerial small-object detection using a customized YOLO26s architecture,
specifically engineered for resource-constrained deployment scenarios. The key challenge:
detecting tiny targets (pedestrians, cyclists, vehicles) in high-resolution drone footage while
fitting within an **8 GB VRAM budget** (RTX 5060 Laptop GPU).

Rather than scaling up hardware, every design decision is evaluated by both accuracy and memory
cost — a discipline forced by the fixed hardware constraint and documented through 20+ versioned
ablation experiments.

**Best model (V16.0):**

| Metric | Value | Note |
|--------|-------|------|
| mAP@0.5 | **74.00%** | V16 (P3+P4 dual-head + CoordAtt), imgsz=800 |
| mAP@0.5:0.95 | **52.11%** | V16 |
| mAP@0.5:0.95 (peak) | **52.65%** | V14 (P3+P4 dual-head, imgsz=960) |
| Parameters | **7.03 M** | V16 |
| Precision | **81.3%** | V16 validation |
| Recall | **67.6%** | V16 validation |
| Inference | **4.0 ms** | RTX 5060 8 GB, imgsz=800, FP16 (avg over 2,224 val images) |

## Motivation & Real-World Significance

While most computer vision research assumes access to high-end GPUs (A100, 4090) and large-scale
cloud compute, real-world work does not always afford that luxury. Fieldwork, in particular,
means carrying a single laptop into the outdoors — and a laptop GPU carries only a few gigabytes
of VRAM. This project grew out of exactly that situation: performing aerial object detection on
a consumer laptop (RTX 5060, 8 GB VRAM) in an outdoor setting, where upgrading hardware or
renting cloud GPUs is not an option.

The question this project asks is therefore not "how high can we push mAP with unlimited
hardware?" — that is well-studied. The question is: **"How good can detection get under a hard
8 GB VRAM budget, and which design decisions matter most under that constraint?"**

The applicant holds a CAAC Beyond-Visual-Line-of-Sight (BVLOS) UAV operator license, which
provides first-hand domain knowledge of real drone flight conditions — altitude constraints,
camera angles, and image distortion. Understanding *why* aerial small-object detection matters
comes from operating drones, not just reading papers about them.

This project is an attempt to bridge that gap — applying rigorous, systematically ablated
computer vision research to a problem defined by real-world deployment constraints.

## The Problem

Aerial small-object detection is hard for three compounding reasons:

- **Tiny targets**: a pedestrian viewed from 100 m+ altitude occupies < 30 pixels — < 1% of the
  image. Standard detection heads routinely miss them.
- **OOM on consumer GPUs**: adding a high-resolution P2 head (25,600 cells) to capture small
  objects causes the TaskAlignedAssigner to allocate an alignment matrix that exceeds 8 GB VRAM
  at batch=4 — the constraint cannot be relaxed by buying hardware.
- **Class imbalance**: person/car dominate; freight and small-bus are rare (each < 2% of instances).

---

## Architecture Modifications

The core improvements target three bottlenecks at once: **positional information loss** (CoordAtt),
**small-object gradient starvation** (WIoU v3, TAL 4px), and **VRAM overcommitment** (P3+P4 dual-head).
All modifications are applied on top of a customized Ultralytics 8.4.12 fork.

1. **Coordinate Attention (CoordAtt)** — injects positional information into channel attention.
   +2.4% Precision gain, negligible parameter cost. Placed per-scale at P3 and P4 neck for
   direct spatial enhancement.
2. **P3+P4 dual-head** — removed the P5 head; reduced parameters by 32% while improving mAP by
   +2.1% on 8 GB hardware. Chosen over triple-head as the production architecture.
3. **WIoU v3 loss** — weighted IoU for better small-object gradient. +1.78% mAP@0.5, zero VRAM cost.
4. **TAL 4 px threshold** — TaskAlignedAssigner positive-sample threshold reduced from 8 px to 4 px,
   directly boosting person/cycle by +6–7% each.
5. **Class weighting** — `[2.0, 3.0, 1.8, 1.5, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]` for the 7 imbalanced classes.

All custom modifications are documented in [`patches/README.md`](patches/README.md) and full
CoordAtt source is in [`patches/coordatt.py`](patches/coordatt.py).

## Hardware Constraints & Solutions

- **GPU**: RTX 5060 Laptop 8 GB — forces batch=4, no P2 head.
- **Solution**: dual-head (P3+P4) architecture reduces feature-map memory while preserving
  small-object detection capability.
- **Trade-off documented**: triple-head V20 improves car detection (+0.6%) but adds ~1 M params and
  VRAM pressure; dual-head V16 is chosen as the production model for the 8 GB constraint.
- **Open problem**: car detection (67.3% on V16) lags small-object classes; current work explores
  SimOTA center-prior and SGLoss-style adaptive grid selection to recover the P2 head's benefit
  without the OOM.

## Quantitative Comparison

To contextualize V16.0's performance, we compare against two standard baselines trained and
evaluated under identical conditions (aerial_v9, imgsz=800, batch=4, 200 epochs, RTX 5060 8GB).

| Model | mAP@0.5 | mAP@0.5:0.95 | Params | VRAM (batch=4) | Notes |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---|
| YOLOv8s (vanilla) | 70.21% | 48.55% | 11.1M | 6.2 GB | Standard triple-head baseline |
| YOLOv8s-p2 | — | — | 11.1M | OOM | P2 head causes allocation failure on 8 GB |
| **YOLO26s + CoordAtt (V16)** | **74.00%** | **52.11%** | **7.03M** | **6.8 GB** | Dual-head + per-scale CoordAtt |
| VisDrone2019 SOTA (YOLOv8s-p2) | ~43.7% | — | 11.1M | — | Public benchmark, 10-class, different dataset |

**Key takeaways from the comparison:**

- V16 outperforms YOLOv8s by **+3.79%** mAP@0.5 while using **37% fewer parameters** (7.03M vs 11.1M).
- YOLOv8s-p2 (the standard high-resolution solution for small objects) cannot run on 8 GB VRAM —
  the dual-head design is not a preference but a necessity under this constraint.
- The VisDrone SOTA comparison (V11: 32.65% vs ~43.7%) is on a different dataset (VisDrone2019,
  10 classes) and should not be interpreted as a direct performance gap against our model. Our
  V11 was a data-quality baseline on intentionally noisy labels; aerial_v9 is a separate,
  cleaned dataset.

> The vanilla YOLOv8s result above was reproduced by us using the same training protocol
> (aerial_v9, 200 epochs, SGD lr₀=0.01, batch=4). All other values are from
> [docs/ablation_table.md](docs/ablation_table.md) or published literature.

## Reproducibility

### Quick Verification (No GPU Required, 50-Image Sample)

A 50-image subset (CC BY 4.0) is included in [`data/val_samples/`](data/val_samples/) for
reviewers to verify the model at small scale.

```bash
# Verify dependencies
python -c "import torch; import ultralytics; print('OK')"

# Verify model config files are valid YAML
python -c "import yaml; [yaml.safe_load(open(f'configs/{c}')) for c in __import__('os').listdir('configs') if c.endswith('.yaml')]; print('All configs valid')"

# Run inference on the 50-image sample (requires best.pt from GitHub Releases)
python scripts/eval.py --weights best.pt --data data/val_samples/val_data.yaml --name sample_verify
```

### Full Training

```bash
# Environment
conda create -n yolo_new python=3.11
conda activate yolo_new
pip install -r requirements.txt          # includes ultralytics==8.4.12 base
# Apply custom patches from patches/ to add CoordAtt, WIoU v3, TAL 4px

# Prepare data
cp data/data.yaml.template data/data.yaml
# Edit data/data.yaml — set path to your aerial_v9 directory

# Train best model (V16, dual-head + CoordAtt)
python scripts/train_v16.py              # ~16.6h on RTX 5060, batch=4, imgsz=800

# Evaluate
python scripts/eval.py --weights V16.0/best.pt --data data/data.yaml
```

> **Model weights**: Download from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ZHY9981/aerial-yolo26s/releases).
> V16 `best.pt` is available as a release asset (~15 MB).

## Key Findings

1. **Data > Architecture**: switching from noisy VisDrone to curated aerial_v9 yielded +12.56%
   mAP@0.5 — more than any architectural change combined.
2. **Attention is cheap but effective**: CoordAtt adds negligible params but +2.4% Precision.
3. **Dual-head beats triple-head on 8 GB**: removing P5 saves 32% params and ~40% VRAM while
   improving mAP by +2.1% — counterintuitive but reproducible under the memory constraint.
4. **Assignment threshold matters for small objects**: TAL 4 px (vs default 8 px) directly boosted
   person/cycle by +6–7%.
